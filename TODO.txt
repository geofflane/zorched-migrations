Extend TransactionalMigration from Migration in core
Add attribute to mark Up/Down method as non-transactional and use base Migration

== Think UnitTesting Framework:
   Expose IDriver in a Setup Attribute marked class/method
   Allow user to override type for a given operation with their own type
   Allow user to register custom types for easy access
   Get an instance for an interface type

Look at Windsor for managing dependencies?
Work on client interface to see if it can be improved

Change CreateSql methods to ToString methods?
Provide IDriver interface for just generating the script without running against the DB

Create attribute to denote an Up/Down method should only be run for a certain Driver type.
Generate schema from existing database
Dump schema changes to stdout/file
Dry run to find out what changes will be applied
Logging?

= MSBuild
ScriptFile to output the scripts that were run
Dryrun

= Operations
Rename table
Rename column
Change column
Add check constraint
Add unique constraint

== Schema inspections
  Column exists
  Table exists
  Constraint exists
  List of tables
